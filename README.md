# INTRODUCTION

Allan E Hewitt Art is an e-commerce website that sells art prints of the artist (Allan E Hewitt).  The artist is a skilled landscape painter and also a well-known soil scientist who creates hand-drawn soil profile pictures.  The website sells examples of the artists oil-based landscape paintings, soil profile drawings, and also other art formats by the artist. The website also showcases the artist's life and work, enabling the user to connect with the artist beyond purchasing his paintings.

# DESIGN

## Colour scheme

The colour scheme was designed to reflect the artist's love of nature, both in painting and in science.  The following colours were chosen:

* #4C694B - Hunter Green - used for buttons throughout the site, this colour links the body of the site with the ferns in the header
* #F5F5F5 - Whitesmoke - used for text
* #F0E68C - Khaki - used for highlighting text and buttons for contrast against the dark background
* #000000 - Black - used to anchor the footer, and for dividers
* #212539 - SlateGray - used for the main background colour, reflecting earthy tones whilst giving good contrast to the lighter text

<details><summary>Colour scheme</summary>
    <img src="/workspace/aeh_art/assets/readme/images/colors.png">
</details>

## Typograhy
Roboto was used as the primary font as it is clear and easy to read.  It was also chosen as it is serious and plain text, which links in with the scientific aspects of the site.  I initally chose Prompt as a secondary font, which was intended to used for paragraph text, but I removeed this during development as I found the readability of the font was poor, particularly in used in bold.  

## Imagery
Imagery was chosen to complement the science theme.  The site concept is designed to reflect the layers of soil in a soil profile (as in much of the artist's art).  The header of ferns represents the top layer/surface, and the colours get darker as the user travels towards the footer, as in many soil profiles.  The background of most of the site was kept simple as a plain slate gray background so as not to distract from the artwork.  The text section on the index page has a background of rocky dark soil, and the footer acts as the bedrock of the layers in strong black.

## Wireframes

Wireframes for the project are below.  Mobile and desktop wireframes were produced using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a>, and main concept visual design page was constructed with <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.  Final product is broadly consistent with the intention and design of the wireframe designs.

</details>
*  During production I dropped the plan to use a carousel on the home page.  This was originally going to hold the awards information, however there were at least 6 or more awards to add.  When I did some reading on the effectiveness of carousels, I found that they aren't well recieved by users for delivering large amounts of information, therefore I changed the awards section to a static page within the 'discover' area of the site, which also flowed better with the the way a user would explore the site.  I was then able to use the empty 'carosel' section on the home page for drawing in the user and explaining the site, and including some SEO.

# Technical Design

## Database schema

Designed at planning stage, the database models were used to guide the development process while building the application.  The initial schema closely reflects the structure of the finished application.

## Agile Methodology

This project was planned and mangaged using an Agile Framework. 

User stories were documented, then placed into a project backlog. Each user story was given a title and a number, and acceptance criteria.  Milestones were created and stories attached to them. Work tracking was done using kanban boards - a separate project board was created for each iteration, and user stories populated to the board from the project backlog.  User stories that ended up as 'won't have' were then returned to the project backlog.  Each board had a to-do, in-progress and done section.

MOSCOW prioritisation was applied to each user story at the outset, and then updated during the project as work progressed. Six prioritisation tasks were used (four for user stories and two for general task tracking):

* Must Have
* Should Have
* Could Have
* Won't Have
* Bug (to track bugs)
* Dev (for development tasks)
