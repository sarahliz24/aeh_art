# Technical Design

## Database schema

Designed at planning stage, the database models were used to guide the development process while building the application.  The initial schema closely reflects the structure of the finished application.

## Agile Methodology

This project was planned and mangaged using an Agile Framework. 

User stories were documented, then placed into a project backlog. Each user story was given a title and a number, and acceptance criteria.  Milestones were created and stories attached to them. Work tracking was done using kanban boards - a separate project board was created for each iteration, and user stories populated to the board from the project backlog.  User stories that ended up as 'won't have' were then returned to the project backlog.  Each board had a to-do, in-progress and done section.

MOSCOW prioritisation was applied to each user story at the outset, and then updated during the project as work progressed. Six prioritisation tasks were used (four for user stories and two for general task tracking):

* Must Have
* Should Have
* Could Have
* Won't Have
* Bug (to track bugs)
* Dev (for development tasks)
