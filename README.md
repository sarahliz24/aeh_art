# DESIGN

## Colour scheme

The colour scheme was designed to reflect the artist's love of nature, both in painting and in science.  The following colours were chosen:

* #4C694B - Hunter Green - used for buttons throughout the site, this colour links the body of the site with the ferns in the header
* #F5F5F5 - Whitesmoke - used for text
* #F0E68C - Khaki - used for highlighting text and buttons for contrast against the dark background
* #000000 - Black - used to anchor the footer, and for dividers
* #212539 - SlateGray - used for the main background colour, reflecting earthy tones whilst giving good contrast to the lighter text

<details><summary>Colour scheme</summary>
    <img src="/workspace/aeh_art/assets/readme/images/colors.png">
</details>

## Typograhy
Roboto was used as the primary font as it is clear and easy to read.  It was also chosen as it is serious and plain text, which links in with the scientific aspects of the site.  I initally chose Prompt as a secondary font, which was intended to used for paragraph text, but I removeed this during development as I found the readability of the font was poor, particularly in used in bold.  

## Imagery
Imagery was chosen to complement the science theme.  The site concept is designed to reflect the layers of soil in a soil profile (as in much of the artist's art).  The header of ferns represents the top layer/surface, and the colours get darker as the user travels towards the footer, as in many soil profiles.  The background of most of the site was kept simple as a plain slate gray background so as not to distract from the artwork.  The text section on the index page has a background of rocky dark soil, and the footer acts as the bedrock of the layers in strong black.

The icons are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank">fontawesome</a>, and used to support clean and intuitive user experience.

### Artwork
* All soil profiles are provided courtesy of the Hewitt Family Trust, and are the artist (Allan E Hewitt's) own work.
* 'Dust to Dust' is provided courtesy of the Hewitt Family Trust, and is the artist's own work.
* Photographs of the artist are provided courtesy of the Hewitt Family Trust.
* Other artwork (landscapes and other categories) are royalty free images from <a href="https://pixabay.com/ " target="_blank">Pixabay</a>. They were chosen due to their similarity to the landscape and other art created by the artist. It is intended that these images will be replaced with the artist's own work in the future.

## Wireframes

Wireframes for the project are below.  Mobile and desktop wireframes were produced using <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a>, and main concept visual design page was constructed with <a href="https://www.canva.com/" target="_blank">Canva</a>.  Final product is broadly consistent with the intention and design of the wireframe designs.

</details>
*  During production I dropped the plan to use a carousel on the home page.  This was originally going to hold the awards information, however there were at least 6 or more awards to add.  When I did some reading on the effectiveness of carousels, I found that they aren't well recieved by users for delivering large amounts of information, therefore I changed the awards section to a static page within the 'discover' area of the site, which also flowed better with the the way a user would explore the site.  I was then able to use the empty 'carosel' section on the home page for drawing in the user and explaining the site, and including some SEO.

# Technical Design

## Database schema

Designed at planning stage, the database models were used to guide the development process while building the application.  The initial schema closely reflects the structure of the finished application.

# Business & Marketing Considerations

## Business Model
Allan E Hewitt is an e-commerce store.  It is a B2C (Business to Customer) store, selling physical products via secure monetary transactions using a single payment model.

## Marketing
Marketing is constructed around social media outreach (Facebook), and newsletter sign-up (Mailchimp).

### Social Media
A facebook page has been created for Allan E Hewitt Art, for marketing purposes in order to increase awareness and increase site traffic.  The facebook page is linked in the site footer.
<details><summary>Facebook page</summary>
    <img src="/workspace/aeh_art/assets/readme/images/facebook.png">
</details>

### Newsletter
<a href="https://mailchimp.com/" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> signup is embedded in the site footer.  This service allows easy sign up services for email marketing and automations.  Any user that signs up via mailchimp has their email address stored on the mailchimp server, and these emails will be used to distribute the site newsletter, in order to increase brand equity and loyalty.

## Search Engine Optimisation

The following were used to increase search engine optimisation for the site:

* Keywords were added to the meta tag within base.html.  These were short-tail and long-tail keywords.  Keywords were also added throughout the text of the site.  These were used to reflect the contents of the site and increase site traffic.
* a Sitemap.xml file was included - this lists the sites important pages, ensuring search engines can find, crawl and index the site.  This can be especially useful for newer sites to help them be found.  
* A robotx.txt file is included - this allows private areas of the site to be disallowed by web crawlers, and includes reference to the sitemap.

# Project Management
....

## Agile Methodology

This project was planned and mangaged using an Agile Framework. 

User stories were documented, then placed into a project backlog. Each user story was given a title and a number.  Milestones were created (as epics) and stories attached to them. Epics were completed one at a time. Work tracking was done using kanban boards - A single board was used for the project, and user stories populated to the board from the project backlog.  User stories that ended up as 'won't have' were then returned to the project backlog.

EPICS:
User stories were broken up into the following epics (each user story was assigned an epic on the site's agile project board).
* Browsing
* Accounts
* Purchasing
* Site Admin
* Contact
* Wishlist
* About

MOSCOW prioritisation was applied to each user story at the outset, and then updated during the project as work progressed. Six prioritisation tasks were used (four for user stories and two for general task tracking):

* Must Have
* Should Have
* Could Have
* Won't Have

Only one user story (#3) ended up as a 'won't have' - This is kept in the backlog for consideration during future iterations of the site.

# Features

## Nav bar
The nav bar has two sections.  A header banner with a fern background and the site logo, with a collapsible nav beneath it. The site logo acts as a home page link. There is a search bar, which displays in the fern header on desktop, and floats right when the nav collapses on smaller screens. The shopping bag link and shopping bag tally float right on the large nav, and sit at the bottom of the nav list when collapsed. The header and nav design are consistent across all pages of the site.  Available dropdown options in the account tab change depending on log in status - if a user is not logged in they only see a log-in and sign-up button, a registered user will see Profile, Wishlist and Logout options, and a superuser will see in addition 'Add Artwork' and 'Add Newsletter' options. The shop dropdown gives user options to go to all artwork, or filter directly by category.

## Home Page

There are two sections to the home page.

### Home Page Section 1

The hero section has simple text banner that announces that prints are available now - indicating quickly the main purpose of the site.  Three of the artwork images for sale are displayed and when clicked all take the user to the main shop page (as does the text banner).  The format changes to stacked on smaller screens.

<details><summary>Home Page - Section 1</summary>
    <img src="/workspace/aeh_art/assets/readme/images/hero.png">
</details>

### Home Page Section 2

Below the hero section is a text section which give further information regarding what the site offers. The words 'Shop now' and 'Discover' are links to take the user to those pages, making it easy to enter the site's main content sections.  The background is an image of dark soil, to simulate the visual concept of soil layers across the whole page.

<details><summary>Home Page - Section 2</summary>
    <img src="/workspace/aeh_art/assets/readme/images/hero2.png">
</details>

## Footer

The footer is black and heavy looking - this is to anchor the pages, and provide a visual feeling of soil layers and bedrock (in balance to the ferns at the header).  It is a fixed footer, and consistent across every page.  Within the footer are social links (to the site facebook page and the site creators linkedin page) and links to the main pages on the site.  Documents and policies for privacy (e.g. GDPR considerations), terms & conditions for site use, and a copyright policy for the artist's artwork open in new tabs when selected.  Mailchimp newsletter signup is embedded in the footer, so that this is visible to the user on every page of the site, maximising liklihood of sign-up.  The footer layout changes as screen size changes.

# BUGS

## Known Bugs
If there is only 1 or 2 product cards returned during a search (e.g. when searching for 'mafic'), the responsive layout distorts the cards at screen widths between 769-1200px. On some aspect ratios the cards are still acceptable for viewing (however are pushed to the left side of the screen), however at some ratios the cards are unsatifactorily distorted. This is due to the layout controls imposed on the card display system. I discovered this bug during final testing and would priorise correcting this in the next revision of the site.  I considered creating code that would restrict the user from searching for only 1 or 2 products, but decided this would be more disruptive to users (many of whom may never encounter the bug, even when searching for only one or two items.)  User can select 'reset' to restore full product listing, or click on the product title or image to go to the product detail view, which will load normally.

 ## Solved Bugs
1. During testing I found the footer was floating on the shopping bag page page.  I initally checked the footer template html and javascript code but couldn't find any errors.  After a long search on stack overflow, I found a post about a similar issue, where the user had an unclosed div breaking their layout.  This prompted me to return to the relevant html and careful count the divs.  I found the table and the subsequent div were not closed, and adding these in corrected the issue.
2. For the quantity input form on the product details page - I had followed the set up and layout for this as per the Code Institude Boutique Ado walkthrough.  In the walkthrough there was a bug noted where the quantity input selectors did not work correctly on large screen layouts (due to the use of IDs instead of classes and the layout being formatted in two different ways meaning the ID didn't work for the second layout). THe isse was that the selector allowed nubmer entry outside of the defined range (1-99).  I tried to update the javascript for the quantity selectors to use classes to solve this but was unsuccessful.  Therefore I decided to modify the layout, so that only one layout schema was required (using flexbox), thus allowing the javascript IDs to function correctly.  However once I had reworked the layout the selectors still were not working correctly (as before).  Once I ensured there were no issues with my HTML, I narrowed down the issue to the javascript.  I did a very close read of the javascript to ensure I very clearly understood what each word in the code was doing. 

                    $('.update-link').click(function (e) {
                        var form = $(this).prev('.update-form');
                        form.submit();
                    }); 

I noted that '.prev' clause related to the previous sibling element, which caused me to re-examine my html set-up.  I identified that during refactoring the html I had broken the parent-child relationship required by the javascript by adding a div in the wrong place.  Reworking the code to move the div so the parent & child elements were adjacent corrected the issue immediately.
